[{"content":"Context A beta version of your awesome open-source software has been released. Great news so far. Except from introducing new features, fixing bugs and answering users' questions, it\u0026rsquo;s really important to have an estimation of the total number of users. In case you are not the only user of your OSS, it\u0026rsquo;s significant to monitor the active users for the following reasons:\n Motivation. Knowing that people are using you software will motivate you to keep maintaining and improving your project. Trustworthy software. Spreading the total number of active users indicates that your OSS is trustworthy.  So, this article is going to present a way to count active users and installations using Github Actions.\nNumerous package distributors Nowadays, there are numerous ways to distribute your OSS. Snapcraft and Flatpak are two of the most known package management tools. Have in mind that you always have to provide the option to \u0026ldquo;Build from source\u0026rdquo; to keep your geek users happy too. In a nutshell, you have to provide various installation methods, therefore, you have to summarize active users from more than one sources.\nCount installations So, let\u0026rsquo;s dig into how to count installations and active users for each installation method.\nKickstart script A common way to distribute your OSS is by providing a kickstart shell script, the purpose of this script is to download, build and install the software locally. In the case of dropboxignore, there is a kickstart script, and the installation instructions look like:\n   Method Command     curl sudo sh -c \u0026ldquo;$(curl -fsSL https://rb.gy/12plgs)\u0026quot; c   wget sudo sh -c \u0026ldquo;$(wget -qO- https://rb.gy/12plgs)\u0026quot; w    as you can see, I\u0026rsquo;m using and extra parameter at the end of each command in order to specify which lib was used to download the script (via wget or curl)\nInside the kickstart file, when installation is completed, I\u0026rsquo;m making few HTTP requests in order to count the installation process that just finished:\nINSTALL_COUNT_URL=\u0026#34;https://api.countapi.xyz/hit/dropboxignore.simakis.me\u0026#34; if [ \u0026#34;$0\u0026#34; == c ]; then curl -s --request GET --url \u0026#34;${INSTALL_COUNT_URL}/wget\u0026#34; \u0026gt; /dev/null curl -s --request GET --url \u0026#34;${INSTALL_COUNT_URL}/total\u0026#34; \u0026gt; /dev/null elif [ \u0026#34;$0\u0026#34; == w ]; then wget -q \u0026#34;${INSTALL_COUNT_URL}/curl\u0026#34; -O /dev/null 2\u0026gt; /dev/null wget -q \u0026#34;${INSTALL_COUNT_URL}/total\u0026#34; -O /dev/null 2\u0026gt; /dev/null fi CountAPI is a simple way to store stateful information like the total number of installations. You have to create a namespace for your project, and after that, make an GET /hit/:namespace?/:key to increase total installations by one.\nFinally, you can get the total number of installations by making an GET /info/:namespace?/:key. In case of dropboxignore:\n$ MANUAL_INSTALLATIONS=$(curl -s https://api.countapi.xyz/info/dropboxignore.simakis.me/total | jq -r .value) $ echo $MANUAL_INSTALLATIONS 12 At the time of writing dropboxignore has been installed 12 times using the kickstart.\nSnapcraft Another common way to distribute your software is as a snap. Snapcraft provides a nice monitoring dashboard:\nBut in our case, this is not enough, we have to extract the raw data programmatically. For this reason we are going to use Snapcraft CLI and Snapcraft Action\nTo get snapcraft metrics, you have to export a credential file and to create a github secret using the content of the exported file:\n$ snapcraft login $ snapcraft export-login exported In order to get the current total number of active user, you have to use the snapcraft metric command:\n$ SNAP_INSTALLATIONS=$( \\  snapcraft metrics dropboxignore --name installed_base_by_channel \\  --start \u0026#34;$(date +\u0026#34;%Y-%m-%d\u0026#34; --date=\u0026#34;yesterday\u0026#34;)\u0026#34; \\  --end \u0026#34;$(date +\u0026#34;%Y-%m-%d\u0026#34; --date=\u0026#34;yesterday\u0026#34;)\u0026#34; \\  --format=json \\  | jq \u0026#39;.series[].values[]\u0026#39; \\  | awk \u0026#39;{s+=$1} END {printf \u0026#34;%.0f\\n\u0026#34;, s}\u0026#39; \\ ) $ echo $SNAP_INSTALLATIONS 118 So, 118 users have installed dropboxignore using snap.\nSummarize The easy part is to summarize user from different sources:\n$ TOTAL_INSTALLATIONS=$((MANUAL_INSTALLATIONS + SNAP_INSTALLATIONS)) $ echo $TOTAL_INSTALLATIONS 130 130 users. I\u0026rsquo;m already boosted morally 🤣.\nAutomate the boring staff using Github Actions Finally, given that we retrieved the necessary information programmatically, we are going to create a nightly job to store active users. The wiki of the repo should be enabled, so, we will use the wiki to store the statistics.\nJSON_BADGE_STRING=$(cat \u0026lt;\u0026lt;-END {\u0026#34;schemaVersion\u0026#34;: 1, \u0026#34;label\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;installations\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;message\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;$TOTAL_INSTALLATIONS\u0026#34;} END ) JSON_FULL_STRING=$(cat \u0026lt;\u0026lt;-END {\u0026#34;manual-installations\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;$MANUAL_INSTALLATIONS\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;snap-installations\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;$SNAP_INSTALLATIONS\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;total-installations\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;$TOTAL_INSTALLATIONS\u0026#34;} END ) FILENAME=\u0026#34;$(date +\u0026#34;%Y-%m-%d\u0026#34; --date=\u0026#34;yesterday\u0026#34;)-stats.json\u0026#34; echo \u0026#34;$JSON_BADGE_STRING\u0026#34; \u0026gt; latest-stats.json echo \u0026#34;$JSON_FULL_STRING\u0026#34; \u0026gt; \u0026#34;$FILENAME\u0026#34; git add latest-stats.json git add \u0026#34;$FILENAME\u0026#34; if ! git diff --staged --exit-code then git config --global user.email \u0026#34;coverage-comment-action\u0026#34; git config --global user.name \u0026#34;Coverage Comment Action\u0026#34; git commit -m \u0026#34;$(date +\u0026#34;%Y-%m-%d\u0026#34; --date=\u0026#34;yesterday\u0026#34;)stats\u0026#34; git push -u origin else echo \u0026#34;No change detected, skipping.\u0026#34; fi Badges everywhere There is always space for one more badge with the total number of Cronjob using Github Actions The number of active users is updated every night using the following job:\nname: Nightly stats on: schedule: - cron: \u0026#34;1 1 * * *\u0026#34; workflow_dispatch: jobs: stats: runs-on: ubuntu-latest steps: - name: Install Snapcraft uses: samuelmeuli/action-snapcraft@v1 with: snapcraft_token: ${{ secrets.SNAPCRAFT_LOGIN_FILE }} - name: Install os dependencies run: sudo apt update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt install curl jq git - name: Create stats file run: sh -c \u0026#34;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sp1thas/dropboxignore/master/utils/stats.sh)\u0026#34; \u0026#39;${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\u0026#39; Next steps  Count manual uninstalls.

Now it\u0026rsquo;s time to document your flows, a simple way to have an overview of your flows is to use the flow visualization.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start by creating an awesome project called example.

Dropbox recently introduced the ability to ignore specific files or folders. Although the significance of the new feature, many users [ 1, 2 , 3, 4] have expressed the importance of ignoring files from Dropbox using Glob just like .gitignore. For various reasons Dropbox doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to have the will to implement such a feature :/\nThe walk-around As a result, I decided to implement dropboxignore which is a simple shell script that ignores files from Dropbox based on glob patterns. Additionally, existing .gitignore files can be used to automatically generate .dropboxignore files.\nThe main difference between dropboxignore and the other relevant projects:\n rozbb/DropboxIgnore swapagarwal/dropbox_ignore ridvanaltun/dropbox-ignore-anywhere MichalKarol/dropboxignore mweirauch/dropignore  is the fact that dropboxignore is implemented in shell and has the minimum requirements (attr package is the only requirement)\ndropboxignore is currently available only for Mac and Linux and has various features:\n Ignore/Revert specific files Automatically update .dropboxignore Revert all ignored files Updated .dropboxignore based on changes in .gitignore file. Generate .dropboxignore files based on existing .gitignore files. Generate, update and ignore using a single command. Delete all .dropboxignore files.  A usecase The simplest usage example could be this: Let\u0026rsquo;s say that you want to ignore every .txt under your Dropbox folder, in that case you only have to run the following command:\n$ dropboxignore ignore *.txt You can find more usage examples here. The full documentation of the project is available here\nThings to not expect from dropboxignore  Automatically ignore new matching files.  When a new file has been created and is matched by a .dropboxignore file, user should re-ignore matching files. A cronjob could solve this drawback.\nAutomatically detect deletions from .gitignore files  Current implementation can detect and update .dropboxignore file if an extra pattern has been added in the corresponding .gitignores but it can not handle deletions in the same way.\n","permalink":"https://simakis.me/posts/exclude-files-using-dropboxignore/","summary":"The \u0026ldquo;Problem\u0026rdquo; A common issue/request about Dropbox was about ignoring files without using Selective Sync.

If the number of images is less than few thousands, when, stop reading this post because you will not face any issue. On the other hand, if you are planing to store numerous images, then consider splitting them in different folders. Listing a directory will become faster, more efficient and at the end of the day, your kernel will be happier. A common pattern is to create a folder structure based on the name of every file. For example, let’s say that path/to/image/dir will be the main directory, and you want to store imagefile.jpg. Create folder structure based on file’s characters and save the file inside the leaf folder:\n$ tree path/to/image/dir path/to/image/dir └── i └── m └── a └── imagefile.jpg A testcase Given the following situation:\n Folder structure’s depth is 3 The maximum number of images per leaf folder is 1000 A common hashing function is used for naming ([a-z0-9])  The main folder can host up to:\n$$\\left ( \\left ( 26 + 10 \\right )^3 \\right ) * 1000 \\approx 46 \\text{ Milion images}$$\nApplication Time to get our hands dirty.\nDescription The purpose of this post is demonstrate an easy way to apply this methodology using scrapy and specifically the ImagePipeline.
