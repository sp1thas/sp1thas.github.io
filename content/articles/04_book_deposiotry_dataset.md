Summary: A large collection of books, scraped from bookdepository.com

While I was trying to master scrapy framework I came up with this project. This is a large collection of books, scraped from bookdepository.com. Yet another dataset of books. By now, the dataset contains more than a million samples. Multiple metadata fields are available for each sample (E.g. title, description, category and others), therefore, this dataset could be appropriate for Text Classification and other NLP tasks.

The dataset is available as [kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/sp1thas/book-depository-dataset).

Additionally, dataset implementation is available [here](https://sp1thas.github.io/book-depository-dataset/).

Any feedback is more than welcome.
